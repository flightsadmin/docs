# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### Weight Calculation Errors

**Issue:** Weight and balance calculations are incorrect.  
**Solution:** Ensure all crew, pantry, and weight data have been entered correctly. Double-check the index values for each entry.

### User Registration Problems

**Issue:** New users cannot register after installation.  
**Solution:** If a user already exists, registration is disabled. Admins can manually add users via the database.

### Deployment Problems

**Issue:** Site is not accessible after deploying.  
**Solution:** Ensure youâ€™ve properly configured the `.env` file and the web server (Apache or Nginx). Check the logs for potential Laravel errors.
